# Business Requirement Document (BRD)
## Project Name: Multi-Agent E-commerce Assistant (Supervisor Pattern)
**Version:** 1.1  
**Status:** In-Development

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
Definition of requirements for a sophisticated **Multi-Agent AI Assistant** extension. This assistant will serve as the primary interface for autonomous shopping tasks within an existing e-commerce environment.

### 1.2 Background
The client has a stable e-commerce platform. The goal is to move beyond manual navigation into an **AI-Orchestrated** experience where multiple specialized agents cooperate to fulfill user requests entirely through natural language.

### 1.3 Project Scope (Agent-Specific)
*   **Orchestration Logic**: Implementation of a **Supervisor Agent** to route requests and maintain state.
*   **Worker Specialized Agents**:
    *   **ProductSearch Agent**: Specialized in deep catalog navigation and specification comparison.
    *   **CartManager Agent**: Specialized in transactional state management (Cart CRUD + Checkout logic).
    *   **OrderTracker Agent**: Specialized in reading historical transaction data.
*   **Platform Integration**: A "Chat-First" UI widget that links conversational intent to backend tools.

### 1.4 Objectives
*   Implement a **multi-agent state machine** (LangGraph) capable of multi-turn reasoning.
*   Automate the full funnel: Search -> Select -> Add to Cart -> Checkout.
*   Ensure the assistant acts with the authority of the authenticated user (Session handling).

## 2. Business Requirements

### 2.1 Functional Requirements (Multi-Agent Logic)
*   **Intent Detection & Routing**: The system must use a Supervisor to parse complex prompts (e.g., "Find me a cheap laptop and check if it's in stock before adding to my cart").
*   **Agent Cooperation**: Worker agents must pass relevant context (e.g., Product IDs) back to the Supervisor for subsequent handoffs.
*   **Autonomous Cart Manipulation**: Agents must be able to verify product availability before performing a "Write" operation to the user's cart.
*   **Agent-Led Checkout**: The assistant must guide the user through the checkout phase, summarizing shipping and total costs conversationally.
*   **Historical Inquiry**: Assistant must provide status updates on orders by interpreting raw database statuses into friendly updates.

### 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements
*   **Reasoning Speed**: Multi-agent routing should not exceed 3 seconds for complex multi-worker handoffs.
*   **Security**: Agents must have **zero-access** to other users' data (Strict `user_id` injection).
*   **Usability**: The Assistant must support "Rich Interactions" (buttons inside chat for quick confirmations).

### 2.3 Constraints and Assumptions
*   **Constraint**: Architecture must strictly use **LangGraph** (no standalone LLM wrappers or MCP).
*   **Assumption**: The underlying e-commerce database supports concurrent agent/manual updates.

## 3. Stakeholders and Roles

| Role | Multi-Agent Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Product searcher (Worker)** | Navigates the product DB to find matches for semantic queries. |
| **Cart Manager (Worker)** | Handles the transactional bridge between AI intent and DB records. |
| **Supervisor (Controller)** | Routes user messages to the correct specialist and formats final responses. |

## 4. Process Flows / Use Cases

### 4.1 Use Case: Complex Task Delegation
1.  **User**: "Check my cart, find a matching bag for the shoes there, and add it."
2.  **Supervisor**: Interprets two tasks.
3.  **Handoff A**: **CartManager** reads current cart; identifies "Red Shoes".
4.  **Handoff B**: **ProductSearch** looks for "Red Bag" matching the shoes.
5.  **Handoff C**: **CartManager** adds the new bag.
6.  **Supervisor**: Confirms the complete journey to the user.

### 4.2 Use Case: AI-Assisted Checkout & Tracking
1.  **User**: "Is my order here yet?"
2.  **Supervisor** -> **OrderTracker Agent**.
3.  **Agent**: "Your latest order #123 is currently in 'Shipped' status. It should arrive by Friday."

---

## 5. Data Requirements
*   **Agent State**: Persisting the "next" node and conversation history in the Database.
*   **Tool Schema**: Standardized input/output for `search_products`, `view_cart`, `add_to_cart`, and `checkout`.

---

## 6. Success Metrics / Acceptance Criteria
*   95% accuracy in routing between Search and Cart managers.
*   Successful injection of `user_id` into all worker tool-calls.
*   Zero "Tool-Loop" errors where agents repeatedly call the same tool incorrectly.

## 7. Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Agent Hallucination** | High | Use structured Pydantic models for Supervisor routing. |
| **Infinite Routing Loop** | Medium | Implement recursion limits in LangGraph configuration. |

# Recreation Prompt: Business Requirement Document (BRD)

> **Role**: You are a Business Analyst.
> **Requirement**: The client has already implemented a basic e-commerce website that allows customers to browse products, add items to the cart, purchase them securely, and track orders. The system also includes a simple admin section for managing products and orders. Now, the client wants to extend the system by adding an AI-powered Assistant using a Multi-Agent architecture, so that instead of manually performing actions like adding items to cart, checkout, and order tracking, the Assistant can perform these actions automatically based on user prompts. The Assistant will work as a chatbot interface embedded within the existing e-commerce platform, where the user can interact conversationally, and the system will coordinate multiple internal agents to complete tasks such as product discovery, cart updates, checkout initiation, and order tracking.
> **Task**: Generate a comprehensive Business Requirement Document (BRD) for the creation of the E-commerce Assistant using a Multi-Agent Architecture.
> **Sections Required**: Introduction (Purpose, Background, Scope, Objectives), Business Requirements (Functional, Non-Functional, Constraints/Assumptions), Stakeholders and Roles, Process Flows / Use Cases (Conversational shopping, Agent-led cart management/checkout/tracking), Data Requirements, Success Metrics / Acceptance Criteria, Risks and Mitigations.
> **Tone**: Professional, client-facing, clear, structured, and business-focused.
